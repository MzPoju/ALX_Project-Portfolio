The project explains the use of Python Programming in calculating the energy efficiency of buildings and structures.

Another technology that may be used is the  Manual J method. This Manual J method takes into account various factors such as the size and location of windows, insulation levels, orientation, and building materials, and other parameters to accurately give detailed analysis of the thermal load of a building. In addition, the Manual J is specifically used for residential buildings, which may limit the intended scope of this project. 

The chosen software program requires HVAC (Heating, ventilation, Air-conditioning) inputs and the use of complex algorithms to analyse the buildingâ€™s characteristics to ensure accurate and timely results.

This project seeks to regulate and maintain indoor temperature of a building as well as tackle the problems of cracking and deformation of building walls which could be a result of imbalanced indoor and outdoor temperatures.

This will be beneficial to everyone, from owners of buildings to the contractors and the occupants.
The calculations are included in the attached files.
