3.4.9.1 Sensible Heat Load due to Infiltration
𝑄𝑠,𝑖𝑛𝑓𝑖𝑙𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 = 𝑚𝑜 𝐶𝑝,𝑚 (𝑇𝑜 − 𝑇𝑖) = 𝑉𝑜 𝜌𝑜 𝐶𝑝,𝑚 (𝑇𝑜 − 𝑇𝑖) Where:
 𝑉𝑜 = (ACH). V / 3600 𝑚3/s
40
𝑚𝑜 = Mass flow rate
 ACH = Air change per hour
 V = Volume of the building
 𝑉𝑜 = Infiltration rate in 𝑚3/s
 𝜌𝑜 = Density in kg/𝑚3
 𝐶𝑝,𝑚 = Specific heat of moist, infiltrated air
 𝑇𝑜 = Outdoor temperature
 𝑇𝑖 = Indoor temperature
 ACH = 3
 Source of ACH: Table 19.8, page 609 of Refrigeration and air conditioning by R.S Khurmi and J.K Gupta
 Therefore, 𝑉𝑜 = (3 × 606.6)/3600 𝑚3/s
 Infiltration rate 𝑉𝑜 = 0.506𝑚3/s
 Where density of gas has a constant value of 1.095kg/𝑚3 and volumetric flow rate is 0.506𝑚3/s
Hence, mass flow rate 𝑚̇ is given from the relation 𝜌 = 𝑚𝑜 𝑉𝑜
So,𝑚̇ =𝜌 × 𝑉 =1.095×0.506=0.554kg/s 𝑜𝑜
𝐶𝑝,𝑚 = Specific heat of moist, infiltrated air = 1025
 𝑚𝑜 𝐶𝑝,𝑚 = 0.02044 (𝑇𝑜 − 𝑇𝑖)
 So, heat gained due to infiltration at the four different hours in which data were collected are:
(a) Heat Load due to Infiltration at 9a.m
𝑚𝑜 𝐶𝑝,𝑚 (𝑇𝑜 − 𝑇𝑖) =𝑉𝑜 𝜌𝑜 𝐶𝑝,𝑚 (𝑇𝑜 − 𝑇𝑖) 0.5554 × 1021.6 (30.6 – 27.6) = 1707.9Watts
(b) Heat Load due to Infiltration at 11a.m
𝑚𝑜 𝐶𝑝,𝑚 (𝑇𝑜 − 𝑇𝑖) =𝑉𝑜 𝜌𝑜 𝐶𝑝,𝑚 (𝑇𝑜 − 𝑇𝑖) 0.5554 × 1021.6 (33.6 – 28.8) = 2723.5Watts
(c) Heat Load due to Infiltration at 1p.m
𝑚𝑜 𝐶𝑝,𝑚 (𝑇𝑜 − 𝑇𝑖) =𝑉𝑜 𝜌𝑜 𝐶𝑝,𝑚 (𝑇𝑜 − 𝑇𝑖) 0.5554 × 1021.6 (36 – 30.0) = 3404.3Watts
(d) Heat Load due to Infiltration at 3p.m
𝑚𝑜 𝐶𝑝,𝑚 (𝑇𝑜 − 𝑇𝑖) =𝑉𝑜 𝜌𝑜 𝐶𝑝,𝑚 (𝑇𝑜 − 𝑇𝑖) 0.5554 × 1021.6 (35.6 – 29.6) = 3404.3Watts	
3.4.9.2 Latent Heat Load due to Infiltration					
𝑄𝑙,𝑖𝑛𝑓𝑖𝑙𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 = 𝑚𝑜 h𝑓𝑔 (𝑊𝑜 − 𝑊𝑖) = 𝑉𝑜 𝜌𝑜 h𝑓𝑔 (𝑊𝑜 − 𝑊𝑖) Where:
 𝑚𝑜 = Mass flow rate
 𝑉𝑜 = Infiltration rate in 𝑚3/s					
𝜌𝑜 = Density in kg/𝑚3
 h𝑓𝑔 = latent heat of vaporization of water = 250
 𝑊𝑜 = Outdoor mass of air in kg/kg read from the psychometric chart 𝑊𝑖 = Indoor mass of air in kg/kg read from the psychometric chart
42
(a) Latent Heat Load due to Infiltration at 9am
𝑚𝑜 h𝑓𝑔 (𝑊𝑜 − 𝑊𝑖) = 𝑉𝑜 𝜌𝑜 h𝑓𝑔 (𝑊𝑜 − 𝑊𝑖) 0.5554 × 2501 × (0.246 – 0.016) = 319.48Watt					
(b) Latent Heat Load due to Infiltration at 11am
𝑚𝑜 h𝑓𝑔 (𝑊𝑜 − 𝑊𝑖) = 𝑉𝑜 𝜌𝑜 h𝑓𝑔 (𝑊𝑜 − 𝑊𝑖)
0.5554 × 2501 × (0.235 – 0.012) = 309.76Watts
(c) Latent Heat Load due to Infiltration at 1pm 𝑚𝑜 h𝑓𝑔 (𝑊𝑜 − 𝑊𝑖) = 𝑉𝑜 𝜌𝑜 h𝑓𝑔 (𝑊𝑜 − 𝑊𝑖)	0.5554 × 2501 × (0.230 – 0.018) = 294.48Watts
(d) Latent Heat Load due to Infiltration at 3pm
𝑚𝑜 h𝑓𝑔 (𝑊𝑜 − 𝑊𝑖) = 𝑉𝑜 𝜌𝑜 h𝑓𝑔 (𝑊𝑜 − 𝑊𝑖) 0.5554 × 2501 × (0.227 – 0.014) = 295.87Watts
					
Total sensible and latent loads are obtained by summing-up all the sensible and latent load components as:
 𝑄𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑏𝑙𝑒,𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 = 700.79 + 837.11 + 633.25 + 494.58 + 2767.40 + 117.95 + 140.67 + 5379.36 + 931.54 + 849.42 + 76.92 + 6088.13 + 1566 + 9490 + 2810 = 31317.12W
 𝑄𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡,𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 = 3485.75 + 1155.97 = 4640.97W
 Total load on the building is:𝑄 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 = 𝑄𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑏𝑙𝑒,𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 + 𝑄𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡,𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 31317.12 + 4640.97 = 35958.09W
Room Sensible Heat Factor (RSHF) is given by 𝑄𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑏𝑙𝑒,𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 / 𝑄𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙
 = 31317.12 /35958.09 RSHF = 0.87
 Therefore, the required cooling capacity, ventilation has been neglected as the calculated infiltration can take care of the small ventilation requirement. Hence, using a factor of safety of 1.25, the required cooling capacity is: 35958.09 × 1.25 = 44948W = 44.9KW
